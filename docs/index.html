# Git vs GitHub
Git: A software that is installed locally on your system.
Used for version control by storing different versions of edits.

GitHub: A service that is hosted on the Web.
It is a tool for integrating git and allowing for collaboration.

      <!-- Slide 2:Git Structured -->
      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
# How is Git Structured?
There are three main layers:
1. Working Directory (Your Files)
- where you can edit your actual code on your computer
- files can be made, modified and deleted
- your local workspace

2. Staging Area (Index)
- a waiting room for your changes that you want to save
- you add files here using git add
- where you choose which changes to include 

3. Local Repository (.git folder)
- where Git stores your project's full history
- created when you run git init and where your changes are saved to
- exists only on your machine until you push it online

Edit code -> git add -> git commit -> git push -> GitHub
Working Directory -> Staging Area -> Local Repo -> GitHub Repo

      <!-- Slide 3: Branches explained -->
      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
# Branches
- a branch is a separate line of development (a copy of your code history)
- the default branch is Main
- you can make new branches to test your code safely without breaking the main code
          git checkout -b NewBranchForTesting
- once you are confident with your changes you can merge them to Main

      <!-- Slide 4: Basic Git Functions -->
      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
# Most used git commands
- git init :start a new Git repo
- git add :stage all changes in the directory for your next commit
- git commit -m :commit the staged changes and add a commit message
- git status :list the files that are staged and unstaged to track where you are
- git branch :list all branches in the repo
- git checkout -b <name> :create AND check out a new branch
- git merge <name> :merge branch <name> into current branch
- git add . :allows you to stage all changes
- git pull :fetches and merges changes from the remote repo
          Always git pull before you start working to avoid version conflict!
- git push :pushes your local commits to a remote repo
- ...(keep adding more!)

      <!-- Slide 5: UV -->
      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
# What is uv and why use it?
- a modern Python environment and dependency manager
- helps organize your project and its packages
- creates a virtual environment
- makes sure your code runs the same on different machines
- allows for easy import of other libraries, modules and packages

Common Commands:
uv init -> start a new project (will auto create README, gitignore, main.py,...)
uv add <package name> -> install packages
uv run python fileName.py -> run code inside your environment
uv pip list -> list all packages that are installed
uv sync -> useful if you change python or dependency versions

      <!-- Slide 6: gitignore -->
      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
# What is a .gitignore File?
- tells Git which files NOT to track
- prevents these files from being accidentally committed to the repository
- keeps your repo clean and professional
- protects private information (API key, large data files)

      <!-- Slide 7: Testing -->
      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
# Testing Code
Importance:
- catches bugs early
- makes sure your code actually works
- keeps big projects from breaking when you change something
Types:
- Unit Testing: test small sections of code (one function)
- Integration Testing: test how sections work together
  YOU SHOULD ALWAYS IMPLEMENT TESTING IN YOUR CODE!

      <!-- Slide 8: Frontend VS Backend -->
      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
# Frontend VS Backend
Frontend:
- what the user sees and interacts with
- test the function of buttons, interface, links...
- uses languages like HTML, JavaScript and CSS
Backend: 
- what runs behind the scenes (server side)
- test if the functions are doing correct calculations, if the API returns the right result...
- uses languages like Python, Java, SQL
